<h1>kube-coder</h1>

**One Helm chart turns a Kubernetes cluster into a fleet of AI-native cloud dev workspaces.**

## The idea

Give every developer — or every AI agent — a real computer in the cloud, and make spinning one up a two-minute, self-service action.

Each **kube-coder workspace** is an isolated pod with a persistent home directory and everything a developer needs, reachable from any browser behind your own GitHub login:

- **VS Code** in the browser (`code-server`)
- a **persistent tmux terminal** that keeps running when you close the tab
- an **in-pod Chrome** you can watch over VNC (for previewing web apps, or letting an agent drive a browser)
- a **dashboard** that ties it together — plus **Chat** that operates the pod *for* you and an **AI CTO** that keeps track of your projects
- **pluggable coding agents** — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Ante, OpenCode — that you can spawn, message, and fan out in parallel

Because it's just Kubernetes underneath, a single chart deploys as many of these as your cluster can hold — each with its own namespace, ingress, TLS certificate, persistent volume, and OAuth allowlist. Onboarding a new teammate is a form in the admin console; their workspace resolves and issues its own TLS on first request.

> **The short version:** it's a self-hosted, multi-tenant, AI-first replacement for "here's a laptop, spend two days setting it up." The environment survives restarts, an in-flight agent keeps working after you disconnect, and you can drive the whole thing from your phone.

### Your laptop is a thin client

The agent doesn't run on your machine. It runs on a pod in a cluster **you** operate — so the repo, the `.env`, the build cache and the model API calls all stay inside your perimeter. Close the lid mid-build and it keeps going.

## Proven on real tasks

kube-coder isn't a demo — the agents inside it solve real problems, and there's a public benchmark to show it.

[**kubecoder-bench**](https://github.com/imran31415/kubecoder-bench) runs coding agents against the [Aider polyglot](https://github.com/Aider-AI/polyglot-benchmark) (Exercism) suite, **scored against hidden tests** — a pass means the agent genuinely solved the task, not that it memorized the answer. Every task runs in its own isolated kube-coder workspace, fanned out across parallel workers.

| Backend | Python split (34 tasks) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Oracle** (reference solutions) | **34 / 34** | validates the harness end-to-end |
| **Claude Code** | **27 / 34 — 79.4%** | single attempt, **no retries**; **~5.3× faster** via parallel workspaces |
| **Ante** (DeepSeek/OpenRouter) | runnable ✓ | agent-agnostic — swap one flag |

The 79.4% is a *conservative floor*: public leaderboards allow multiple attempts, this run allows one. The point isn't a headline number — it's that **the same infrastructure this repo ships parallelizes real agent work across isolated environments and validates it honestly.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imran31415/kubecoder-bench && cd kubecoder-bench
./setup.sh
python3 harness/bench.py --lang python --backend claude --workers 6
```

## See it

Three screenshots that capture the whole idea — a workspace home you drive from one composer, every agent in one queue, and a chat that operates the pod for you:

## Chat — talk to your workspace, and it acts

<img width="100%" alt="Hypervisor chat calling get_metrics and list_tasks" src="docs/screenshots/hypervisor-chat.png" />

**Chat** is the feature that makes a kube-coder pod feel alive — internally the *Hypervisor*, which is the name you'll see in the code and specs. You talk to the workspace in plain language and it *does the thing*:

> *"How many tasks are running and what's my CPU?"* · *"Spin up a build to run the tests."* · *"Remember that I deploy with `make ship`."* · *"Pin port 3000 to Apps."*

Under the hood it's not a screen-scraped terminal — each thread is a **structured agent session**. Your chosen CLI (Claude, Codex, Ante, …) runs headless over pipes, and a canonical event stream renders clean prose plus expandable tool cards. It's wired to three MCP servers so it can genuinely operate the pod:

- **dashboard** — read metrics/tasks/health, create & message builds, pin apps, manage memory
- **memory** — persistent facts about you and your projects
- **agent-orchestrator** — spawn and coordinate sub-agents

Destructive actions (`kill_task`, `delete_memory`) ask for confirmation right in the chat. It's fully mobile, works with whichever assistant you pick, and survives pod restarts (the Claude adapter `--resume`s its session). See [`docs/hypervisor-spec.md`](docs/hypervisor-spec.md) for the architecture.

---

## AI CTO & Feed — someone minding the whole thing

**Chat** operates the pod. The **AI CTO** (`/cto`) works a level up: it holds a picture of your *projects*.

Projects are discovered automatically — no forms. Each carries its own north star, decision log, goals and memory namespace, and the CTO answers from a live brief (running builds, recent activity, open threads) rather than from whatever happens to be in context. Ask it what to work on next and it argues from the actual state of the repo.

The **Feed** (`/feed`) is the single stream of what changed and what needs you: build outcomes, decisions recorded, trigger fires, plus anything an agent judged worth surfacing. Anything in it can be handed straight to the CTO with **"Discuss with CTO."**

Both are on the phone app too.

---

## Bring your own environment — `devcontainer.json`

If a repo already carries a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — because it came from Codespaces, Coder, Ona or DevPod — kube-coder reads it. Forwarded ports land on the **Apps** page with their labels, VS Code extensions and settings reach code-server, `containerEnv`/`remoteEnv` reach the agents you dispatch, and the lifecycle commands are shown to you *verbatim* so you can run them with one click. Moving a project across stops being "rebuild your environment by hand" and becomes "point it at the repo."

It interprets the file inside the workspace pod rather than building a container, so `features`, `image`, `build` and `dockerComposeFile` **cannot** be honoured — the pod runs as UID 1000 with no privilege escalation and there is no Docker daemon. Those come back named, with the reason and a remedy, instead of being silently dropped: a workspace that *looks* configured and isn't is the worst outcome for something whose whole job is migration.

Nothing from a cloned repo ever runs on discovery. Consent is pinned to the file's hash, so if `devcontainer.json` changes between the dialog and your click the server refuses rather than running text you never read. See [`docs/devcontainer.md`](docs/devcontainer.md).

---

## Build sessions & parallel agents

A **build session** is an interactive Claude / Codex / Ante / OpenCode tmux session inside the pod. Start one from the dashboard, the phone app, or the API; it survives restarts, and its output is mirrored to a log you can tail from anywhere.

The **New build** flow is deliberately minimal — pick an assistant + working directory, get a memorable name (`funny-kitty-37`), and land straight in a live terminal. No prompt box to fill out first; type your first prompt in the REPL, like you would locally.

**Parallelism is the point.** The built-in **agent-orchestrator** MCP lets any session spawn sub-agents — across *different* harnesses — to fan work out and collect results:

```
spawn_agent("Refactor module A", assistant="ante")     → task_1
spawn_agent("Write tests for module C", assistant="claude") → task_2
wait_for_agent(task_1); wait_for_agent(task_2)         → synthesize
```

Guardrails (max spawn depth, max concurrent agents) keep a runaway loop from fork-bombing the pod.

### API

```bash
# POST /api/claude/tasks  (oauth2 headers OR Authorization: Bearer <token>)
curl -s https://<user>.dev.example.com/oauth/api/claude/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "review this PR", "assistant": "claude"}'
```

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/claude/tasks` | Create a build (prompt optional) |
| `GET  /api/claude/tasks` | List sessions |
| `GET  /api/claude/tasks/{id}` | Detail |
| `GET  /api/claude/tasks/{id}/output` | Tail the tmux pane |
| `GET  /api/claude/tasks/{id}/stream` | SSE live stream |
| `POST /api/claude/tasks/{id}/message` | Send a follow-up prompt |
| `DELETE /api/claude/tasks/{id}` | Kill the tmux session |

Full reference: [`docs/claude-task-api.md`](docs/claude-task-api.md). There's also a `/remote-task` skill to dispatch a prompt from a lighter workspace to a stronger one and stream the result back.

## What's in a workspace

Every workspace exposes the same set of surfaces, all behind a single GitHub OAuth login:

| Surface | What it is | Access URL |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard SPA** | Vite + Preact app: Desktop, Hypervisor, Build, Memory, Triggers, Apps, Skills, Files, Settings | `/` |
| **Hypervisor** | Chat that reports live state and acts on the pod | `/` → Hypervisor |
| **Terminal** | ttyd-attached tmux, reachable from any browser | `/oauth/terminal/` |
| **VS Code** | `code-server` rooted at `/home/dev` | `/oauth/vscode/?folder=/home/dev` |
| **In-pod browser** | Chrome on a virtual X display, viewed via noVNC | `/oauth/vnc-direct/vnc.html` |
| **Metrics + health** | Live CPU / Mem / Disk + service health | `/oauth/metrics`, `/oauth/health` |
| **Assistants** | Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Ante, OpenCode, LibreFang | per-session |

### The dashboard

<img width="100%" alt="Desktop home tab (light theme) with the centered composer and Mission Control strip" src="docs/screenshots/desktop-redesign-light.png" />

The dashboard at `/` is a single Preact app:

- **Desktop** — your workspace home: a centered ask-anything / start-a-build composer, a Mission Control strip of recent agents, and a dock of pinned shortcuts.
- **Mission Control** — every agent across builds, chats, and sub-agents on one board: waiting on you, running, and done.
- **Build** — live + past agent sessions on the left, a detail pane on the right with **Terminal**, **Preview** (split ttyd ┃ noVNC), **Send message** (chat mirror of the tmux pane, with image paste), **Info**, and **Subagents** tabs.
- **Memory** — persistent, SQLite-backed memory with history + relations, mirrored over MCP.
- **Triggers** — webhooks + cron jobs that spawn builds on a schedule or an inbound POST.
- **Apps** — pin a running port (e.g. `:3000`) to preview your app inside the dashboard.
- **Skills** — browse and sync `SKILL.md` files across every harness in the pod.
- **Files** — read the PVC, upload files, make directories.
- **Settings** — appearance, GitHub identity, subscription logins, browser/VNC controls, and real-time metrics with alerts.

A persistent top bar shows live CPU/mem/disk and one-click VS Code + New-terminal buttons. **It's fully responsive** — below 720px the rail collapses to a bottom nav, the detail pane becomes a swipeable sheet, and the layout re-flows for touch.

---

## Persistent memory

Every workspace has a SQLite-backed memory store — facts about you, your projects, and your conventions — reachable three ways:

- **Dashboard → Memory** (CRUD with history + relations)
- **MCP server** auto-spawned for every agent (read + write from inside the assistant)
- **REST** at `/api/memory`

Agents read it on demand; optional pre-injection (`KC_MEMORY_PREINJECT=1`, off by default) prefixes a new build's prompt with the most relevant records. It's how the Hypervisor "remembers that I deploy with `make ship`" and how a fresh session already knows your setup. Deep dive: [`docs/persistent-memory.md`](docs/persistent-memory.md).

---

## Triggers — webhooks, crons, completion hooks

Three ways to start a build without clicking **New build**:

1. **Completion hooks** — fire a webhook when an agent finishes (status, output URL, summary).
2. **Webhooks** — accept inbound POSTs and turn the body into a build prompt via a template.
3. **Crons** — UNIX cron expressions that POST to a webhook on a schedule.

All three live under **Triggers**, and what-fired-what is tracked in the memory store.

---

## Chat over WhatsApp

Drive your workspace agent from WhatsApp. The gateway is **opt-in** and
**bring-your-own-credentials** — connect your own Twilio (or Meta) app from
**Settings → Messaging / WhatsApp**, paste the webhook URL into the provider
console, tap **Link WhatsApp**, and text the pairing code once. After that you
just chat: messages drive a Hypervisor turn and replies come back to your phone,
with keyword commands (`new chat`, `stop`, `unlink`, `workspaces`, `@ws`) and a
fail-closed signature check on every inbound. The same card is in the mobile app.

Full guide: [`docs/whatsapp-gateway.md`](docs/whatsapp-gateway.md).

---

## Pluggable AI assistants

Every session — and every orchestrator sub-agent — picks its assistant at create-time, so you can mix them freely in one workspace. Keys live in `users-private/<name>/secrets/assistant.yaml` (gitignored); the public defaults are empty, so it ships Claude-only out of the box, and users can add their own provider keys self-service from **Settings**.

Assistant, model and **reasoning effort** (`low → max`, translated to each CLI's native knob) can be set per turn, or saved as a **per-project default** so the CTO dispatches work with the right one without being told.

| Assistant | Backend | Configure with |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (default) | Anthropic API key or subscription login | `claude.apiKey`, or `make shell USER=<name>` → `claude` to log in once |
| **Codex** | OpenAI's terminal agent; ChatGPT OAuth (no API key) | `codex login` once in the pod |
| **Google Gemini** | Google's `gemini` CLI (default `gemini-2.5-pro`) | `assistant.gemini.apiKey` |
| **Ante** | Antigma's terminal agent; defaults to **DeepSeek v3.2 via OpenRouter** | `assistant.openrouter.apiKey` (CLI pre-installed) |
| **OpenCode → OpenRouter** | any OpenRouter model | `assistant.openrouter.apiKey` + `model` |
| **OpenCode → DeepSeek** | DeepSeek native API | `assistant.deepseek.apiKey` |
| **LibreFang** | open-source agent OS; reuses set provider keys | `assistant.librefang.agent` |

### A "Claude-like" agent without an Anthropic key — Ante + DeepSeek

Pair the [**Ante**](https://ante.run/) CLI — pre-installed in every workspace — with **DeepSeek** and you get a Claude-Code-style experience: autonomous multi-step edits, shell/file tools, and the **same MCP memory + orchestrator servers** Claude uses, at a fraction of the cost. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and Ante defaults to `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` (~$0.23 / $0.34 per 1M in/out tokens) — cheap enough to be the default background sub-agent in the orchestrator.

## Mobile app (iOS & Android)

<img width="500" height="580" alt="kube-coder mobile app" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f2e7ad-7939-4ad1-9623-d9fa1d4e3278" />

Beyond the responsive web dashboard, kube-coder ships a native **Expo / React Native app** ([`mobile/`](mobile/)) to drive your workspace from your phone: list / create / message / kill agent sessions, tail their **color terminal output** with a control-key bar (Shift-Tab, Esc, arrows, Ctrl-C, Paste), chat with the **Hypervisor**, attach photos to a follow-up, search memory, and watch live metrics — all over the workspace's Bearer-token API. It points at **any** kube-coder host: a cloud workspace, or a local minikube one via `make mobile-forward`.

```bash
cd mobile && npm install
npm run ios          # iOS Simulator   (or: npm run android / npm run web)
```

Enter your **workspace host** + **API token** (copy both from **Settings → Mobile app**) on the first screen. Store builds use EAS — no Mac needed:

```bash
make mobile-build         # EAS cloud build (iOS .ipa + Android .aab)
make mobile-screenshots   # regenerate App Store / Play Store screenshots
```

Full walkthrough: [`mobile/README.md`](mobile/README.md).

## Quick start

kube-coder runs two ways — pick the one that fits:

| | **Local (minikube)** | **Cloud / multi-tenant** |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | trying it out, dev, offline | real deployments, teams |
| Needs | Docker + minikube | a cluster, registry, DNS, GitHub OAuth |
| Auth | http basic (`admin`/`admin`) | GitHub OAuth2 (or basic) |
| TLS | none (plain HTTP, localhost) | cert-manager + Let's Encrypt |
| Guide | [Option A](#option-a--local-minikube) + [docs/local-development.md](docs/local-development.md) | [Option B](#option-b--cloud--multi-tenant) + [docs/NEW_USER_PROVISIONING.md](docs/NEW_USER_PROVISIONING.md) |

> **📖 Follow-along walkthroughs:**
> - [Getting started on a MacBook with minikube](docs/getting-started-minikube-macos.md) — clean laptop → local dashboard
> - [Deploying on Kubernetes (multi-tenant, OAuth + TLS)](docs/deploy-on-kubernetes.md) — cluster → per-user workspace

### Option A — Local (minikube)

Run the whole stack on a local single-node cluster — no cloud account, registry, DNS, or TLS.

**Prerequisites:** Docker, minikube, kubectl, helm (`brew install minikube kubectl helm` on macOS).

```bash
make local          # start minikube, build the image, deploy, and print access info
```

**Then reach the dashboard:**

```bash
echo '127.0.0.1  kube-coder.local' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts   # one time
make local-forward                                            # keep running in a terminal
# open http://kube-coder.local:8080/   →   basic auth: admin / admin
```

`make local` wraps steps that each run on their own (`local-up`, `local-build`, `local-secret`, `local-deploy`, `local-info`, `local-down`). Everything targets the minikube context explicitly, so it never touches a remote cluster. Full guide: [docs/local-development.md](docs/local-development.md).

### Option B — Cloud / multi-tenant

**Prerequisites:** Kubernetes 1.19+, Helm 3.0+, an nginx-ingress controller, **wildcard DNS** (`*.<your-domain>` → the ingress IP), a GitHub OAuth App for the controller console, a private GitHub repo as the GitOps config store, and a `regcred` image-pull secret.

```bash
DOMAIN=<your-domain> make doctor  # preflight: check ALL of the above at once (read-only)
make deploy-base                  # base infra: nginx-ingress, oauth2-proxy, cert-manager
make ship-controller-config       # the admin console (workspace-controller)
```

Run `make doctor` **first**. It's a read-only preflight that verifies every prerequisite above — kubectl/helm versions, the ingress controller and its external IP, cert-manager plus a ClusterIssuer, that `*.<your-domain>` actually resolves **to your ingress IP** (the failure that otherwise only surfaces as a dead workspace later), the `regcred` secret, and GitOps-repo reachability — reporting all failures at once with a fix for each. Pass `DOMAIN=<your-domain>` to include the wildcard-DNS check (skipped otherwise).

Two things make self-service onboarding work; you set them once:

- **Wildcard DNS** — point `*.<your-domain>` at your ingress IP. Every workspace lives at `<github-login>.<your-domain>`, so a new user's host resolves the moment they're created, and **cert-manager + Let's Encrypt** issues its TLS cert on first request.
- **The console's GitHub OAuth App + admin allowlist** — gates the dashboard at `controller.<your-domain>`; only allowlisted logins may administer workspaces. One-time config: [docs/PROVISIONING.md](docs/PROVISIONING.md).

#### Onboard a user — the 2-minute dashboard flow

> **Scenario.** Dana (`@dana-codes`) joins Monday morning and needs a full cloud workspace before standup.

1. **Open the console** at `https://controller.<your-domain>` → **New workspace**.
2. **Look up the user** — type `dana-codes`, hit **Look up**. The controller confirms it's a real GitHub account and shows the host: `dana-codes.<your-domain>`.
3. **Create a GitHub OAuth App** — the one manual step (GitHub has no API for it). The form shows the exact Homepage + callback URLs.
   > ⚠️ It must be an **OAuth App** (Client ID starts with `Ov…`), *not* a GitHub App (`Iv…`), which silently 404s the login.
4. **Paste & create** — drop the Client ID + Secret into the form → **Create workspace**. The controller commits Dana's config to your GitOps repo and launches a provisioner Job; the page streams the rollout: *Starting → Deploying → **Workspace ready***.
5. **Hand it off** — send Dana `https://dana-codes.<your-domain>`. She signs in with her own GitHub account (she, and only she, is on the allowlist) and lands in VS Code, a terminal, and Claude Code. Elapsed time: a couple minutes, most of it the image pull.

#### Manage a user — limits, updates, lifecycle

<img width="406" height="292" alt="controller edit-limits panel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c82035dc-2c67-4aae-ac39-5041f7a4e7f5" />
<img width="375" height="556" alt="controller mobile management" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261df033-7576-43f1-b094-8aea551acc6f" />

All per-workspace, in the same console:

- **Right-size resources** — **Edit limits** → set CPU / memory. Applying patches the live pod **and** commits the new limits to GitOps, so it's durable across redeploys. Live usage + estimated monthly cost sit right above the control.
- **Keep them current** — each workspace shows its release and an **update** action; users can also self-update from their own dashboard.
- **Pause to save spend** — **Stop** scales the pod to zero (PVC preserved); **Start** brings it back unchanged.

#### Automation / break-glass: the CLI

The same workspaces are fully operable from the Makefile — for scripting, CI, or when the console is down. Config lives in the GitOps repo; `make users-sync` checks it out locally so CLI and console share one source of truth:

```bash
make users-sync                   # pull the GitOps config store into .users/
make new-user      USER=<name>    # scaffold a workspace (prints the OAuth-App checklist)
make deploy        USER=<name>    # helm upgrade --install
make logs|shell|test USER=<name>  # operate a running workspace
make stop|start    USER=<name>    # scale to zero / back
```

## Architecture

![kube-coder workspace topology](docs/diagrams/topology.png)

A per-user PVC mounted at `/home/dev` survives pod restarts; the tmux sessions attached to it survive too, so an in-flight agent build keeps running even after you close the tab. `oauth2-proxy` injects `X-Auth-Request-User` on every `/oauth/*` route; each workspace's proxy is pinned to exactly one GitHub login.

### Isolation & security posture

Each workspace is a tenant boundary, not a folder:

- **Its own namespace** (`ws-<user>`) with a dedicated ServiceAccount, ResourceQuota and LimitRange — scoped so a workspace can read nothing outside itself.
- **NetworkPolicy both ways** — ingress only from `ingress-nginx`; egress denied to the cloud metadata endpoint and to other tenants' pods, while normal internet (GitHub, npm, registries, model providers) stays open.
- **No signing keys in the agent's container** — the GitHub App private key lives in its own sidecar, which hands the `ide` container only an hourly token.
- **Agent-readable instruction files are scanned** for hidden-text prompt injection (zero-width and Unicode-tag characters in `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, …) — the technique used by the 2026 TrapDoor supply-chain campaign.
- **Provisioning is opt-in and constrained** — a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy pins the shape of the privileged Job, and chart refs must be immutable.

Full policy, reporting process and hardening defaults: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) · [`docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md`](docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md).

## Common commands

```bash
# Docker image
make build / make push / make clean

# Per-user lifecycle
make deploy   USER=<name>         # helm upgrade --install
make ship     USER=<name>         # build + push + roll the pod
make rollback USER=<name>         # helm rollback
make logs|shell|test USER=<name>  # operate a running workspace

# Dashboard SPA
make dashboard-web                # type-check + vite build → web/dist
make dashboard-web-test           # vitest unit tests

# Tests across the repo
make test-all-units               # SPA (vitest) + server.py (unittest)
make coverage                     # HTML coverage reports

# Cluster status
make status                       # helm + pod status
```

`make help` (or just `make`) lists everything with one-line descriptions.

## Testing & code quality

| Component | Coverage | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend (Dashboard)** | 41.6% | Vitest + @testing-library |
| **Backend (Python API)** | 74% | unittest + coverage.py |
| **Overall** | 60% | statement-weighted average |

```bash
make test-all-units    # SPA + Python unit tests (run before every PR)
make coverage          # HTML reports → web/coverage/ and htmlcov/
```

All tests run automatically on GitHub Actions.

---

## Development

```bash
# Run the SPA locally against a built dist with auth bypassed
make dashboard-web
DASHBOARD_DIST_DIR=$(pwd)/charts/workspace/web/dist \
  python3 charts/workspace/web/dev_server.py
# → http://127.0.0.1:7070
```

Pull requests welcome — please run `make test-all-units` and keep coverage healthy before opening a PR. Contribution guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
